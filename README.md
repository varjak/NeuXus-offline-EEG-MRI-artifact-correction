This is the version of NeuXus online EEG MR-artifact correction in simple python.
https://github.com/LaSEEB/NeuXus

The output should be virtually the same as with the online version.

It is specially useful for debugging, because it's written in simple python, allows breakpoints and plotting. Yet, it can also be used to correct data retrospectively (from files). 

It includes two files, one simulating the Gradient Artifact (GA) and another the Pulse Artifact (PA), each as a sinusoid.
